Digitek Printer (short: DP) was written to compare an effort in writing
the same program in different languages: C and OCaml.

The project is released under the BSD license.

DP reads data sent by a Digitek DT-9062 printer from a specified
(on the command line) serial port, interprets the data and prints it,
running in a loop. The first key press interrupts the program,
which closes the serial port and exits then.
